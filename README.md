# Fraud-Detection-in-Banking-Transactions-Using-Hadoop
Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions Using Hadoop is a scalable Big Data solution designed to identify and prevent fraudulent financial activities by analyzing massive volumes of banking transaction data. Leveraging the Hadoop ecosystem—including HDFS, Spark, Kafka, Hive, and optional machine learning libraries—this system enables real-time and batch-based fraud detection through rule-based logic and behavioral analytics. It ingests data from multiple sources, processes it to detect anomalies, and generates alerts, risk scores, and insightful dashboards for compliance and fraud analysis teams. This project helps financial institutions enhance digital trust, reduce financial risk, and comply with AML and KYC regulations.
